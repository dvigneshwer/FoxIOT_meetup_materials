Docker helps in shipping and deployment in a most efficient manner.

How to use :

* create a docker file with all your dependecies and software tar balls

* build the docker image

docker build -t image_name:version .


* Once you have built it,

docker images #you can see your image listed here

docker ps # a container will be running 

docker ps -a

docker ps $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited) #Kills your container


* start your docker image

docker run -it image_name:version bash

docker exec -it image_name:version bash

cntrl +D to stop the container

cntrl + P + Q to go out of the container without killing it


*to commit your changes

docker commit container_id image_name:tag


*To push and pull docker image

docker push image_name
docker pull image_name
