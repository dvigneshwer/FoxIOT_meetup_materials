# Why behind different Topics Covered :

The first page of the gitbook show cases the different topics and technologies we have been playing with in this 6 meetups.

Lets discuss why we selected the topics for the IOT meetup.

## Introductions to git

This is simplest of them all,

* Version management, you can easily go back to a previous commit incase of any screw up the participants of the group
* Lets you access the code anywhere from the web
* Supports Open source and projects sprit
* Lets you have features such as issues to discuss on topics :) 

## Introduction to shell scripting

* Basic commands to create folder structure for supporting your code layouts
* We mostly worked with the linux distributions
* Gives you an additional advantage to control things in your kernel

## Introduction to Docker and commands

* Contenirzation is very important when you want to ship the project
* Created docker file to make sure the app was easily deployed at any enviroment

## Introductions to python and main libraries

* The kind of modules avaibale in python in countless
* Python is a master of all trades, I can't imagine an application which we can't make with python
* It's easy to use and can start hacking asap :) 

## Learning Rust Language

* We love Mozilla and it's innovations
* Rust is a fast system programming language
* Learned it in order to kow about kernel level languages which provides us more flexibility in terms of better hacks

## Concepts of Image processing

* Giving eyes to 

## Python API

* Learning about REST apis via request module
* Aloows us to do remote commands

## LED Expt

* Understanding the libraries to control the LED from the GPIO pins

## Python packaging

* To provide the code in form of a binary for all to ruse

## Ansible

* Configurtion management
* In order to setup the device on the fly 

## Web Services

* Rest Api's to trigger the backend for performing the job in the IOT device
* Used Flask to start a webserver

## Web UI

* Contains HTML, CSS and JS to provide web dashboard control to the PI board
* This is a POC for remote access control

## GitBook Documentation

* Docuentation in its best form with an very readable manner for all to reproduce the experiments and activites
* Its free and easy to setup

## Dash Boarding

* Web dash to monitor the pi
* Lets you perform analyrics and make business decision
* Sums up all your effort with great visualization
