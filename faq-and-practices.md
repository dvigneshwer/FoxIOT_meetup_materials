# Tips and Tricks for IOT Meetups

## How to share Infrastructure :

One of the major problems with IOT sessions are hardware and their software dependencies, a lot of time is spent on setting up the stage.

For casual researach oriented discussion we can't afford to purchase all the IOT hardware and spend enough time to setup dependencies.

Few things which really helped us are :- 

* Sharing the IOT hardware via SSH 

* SSH allows you to access a machine via terminal and helps you perform your code

* Make sure your device and the host you are connecting to are in the same network, by network I mean you are connected to same wifi in order to avoid firewal and other network blockages

* We used [https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroupLessons/tree/master/Ansible_intro ansible playbooks] to irradicate spending time for setting up dependencies in the new board.

# Coding Tips

* Always have a header to the code,

~~~~
Task : What are you accomplishing
Date : When was this written
Version : Tweaks made
Author : Your name
~~~~

* Use a comment as a header to all the functions and classes you use

* Make a dcoumentation of how to use your code and what all could be the possible problems that you can face

* List out all the links which you used as a reference to build the project

# Group Division

There is nothing best than working as a group, multiple ideas and views to make the code bug free (This can't be promised)

* Keep all the group engaged when you are solving a bug, display your efforts in the projector or the LCD screen

* Make sure to have a equal group in terms of expertise often you will find a group completed and sitting idle

* Make sure that group has individual contributors for the different aspects of the experiments
