# How to contribute to the Kit ? 

In the 6 meetups we have documented almost all of the topics we have discussed.

We would love other study & interests group to go ahead and hack it.

* Clone the repo 

````
git clone https://github.com/dvigneshwer/FoxIOT_meetup_materials.git
````

* Make changes to the contents and give a PR, we will be more than happy to add it here

* Implementing projects, there are a lot of project ideas which we have listed during the design spirint. Feel free to hack them and make the implementation open.

* Raise issues in case of any doubts in the way we have implemented projects, this will help in QA and will be a good documentation for people facing the same problems

* Create videos of the projects and share it to the FoxIOT group via #FoxIOT and @MozillaTN in twitter

* Send a PR to (Mozilla Science Study Group Lessons)[https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroupLessons/] so that study groups around the globe can consume it :)
